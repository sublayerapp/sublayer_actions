# Sublayer Actions
Sublayer Actions are small, reusable components in the [Sublayer AI Framework](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer).

They are responsible for performing specific operations to either get inputs to send to an LLM inside a `Sublayer::Generator` or to
perform an action in a service in response to data returned from an LLM.

`Sublayer::Actions` are designed to be generated by an LLM, and to that end, this repo has many automated workflows to grow capabilities over time.

So far we have:
* Every day, Gemini, GPT-4, and Claude make a PR with a suggestion for a new `Sublayer::Action`
* Any time a PR is merged, Gemini, GPT-4, and Claude make a new PR that's a riff off the thing that was merged
* Any time a PR is merged, a message is sent to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gge62VGH6U) in the `#actions` channel describing the change and offering some ideas for how it could be used in AI applications.

Many more ideas and integrations to come!
