# Description: Sublayer::Action responsible for backing up data or reports to cloud storage services like
# Google Drive or AWS S3. This action ensures data protection by automating the backup process.
#
# It is initialized with cloud provider specifics such as bucket_name (for AWS S3) or folder_id (for Google Drive),
# the file_path of the data to backup, and optional settings like encryption.
#
# Example usage: When you want to regularly backup reports generated by an AI process to cloud storage.

require 'aws-sdk-s3'
# Note: Add google-api-client for Google Drive integration if needed
